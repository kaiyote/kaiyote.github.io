description: Lets walk through building a simple Lit component, perhaps even the one I asked ChatGPT to write in the previous post, and cover all the basics of why I like Lit.

So, you think you want to get into Lit, but diving into a whole new framework feels like effort, and you just wish someone would give you some simple to follow instructions
to make life easier. Well, there's the [Lit Getting Started](https://lit.dev/docs/getting-started/) page, but since you're here, lets assume you'd prefer me to walk you
through it, or you're after a less "clinical" approach to setting up a project.

## Project Setup
First things first, we're going to want a project to work in. So,
```bash
$ mkdir lit-component-project

$ cd lit-component-project

$ npm init

$ npm i vite lit typescript
```
We make a folder (you can replace `lit-component-project` with whatever floats your boat right now), `cd` into it, `init` an npm project in that folder, and install a few key dependencies.

- `vite` - this is our build tool, almost zero config, simple, fast, modern, I wouldn't use anything else nowadays to be honest  ([vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/))
- `lit` - this is where all the `lit` code lives, we need this to write anything in `lit`
- `typescript` - let's be honest here, Types are Goodâ„¢. I don't write Javascript anymore, only Typescript, and so we'll be using Typescript here

Then you'll want to make a few files:
{% endrenderTemplate %}

<playground-project id="starter-project">
  <script type="sample/html" filename="index.html">
    <!doctype html>
    <head>
      <script type="module" src="./index.js">&lt;/script>
    </head>
    <my-lit-component></my-lit-component>
  </script>
  <script type="sample/ts" filename="index.ts">
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit'
import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js'

@customElement('my-lit-component')
export class MyLitComponent extends LitElement {
  render () {
    return html`<span>Hello, World!</span>`
  }
}
  </script>
</playground-project>
<playground-tab-bar project="starter-project" editor="starter-editor"></playground-tab-bar>
<playground-file-editor id="starter-editor" project="starter-project" line-numbers read-only></playground-file-editor>
