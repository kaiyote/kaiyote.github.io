# About Me

I write oodles of Javascript (technically Typescript) and Javascript Accessories. I'm interested in always finding new and interesting ways to solve problems at work.
On a quest to find The One Framework To Rule Them All (while being completely convinced this doesn't actually exist). Started my Javascript Journey w/ raw moustache templates,
jquery, and server templating. Discovered true joy with React back when Hooks were beta and "not production ready". Dipped into Mythril, AngularJS, Angular 2+, Ember, with
results varying from moderate interest to outright horror (result order matches the listed order of frameworks). Vue 3 is currently my go-to "enterprise"-y framework of choice,
specifically with Composition API and the `<script setup>` config. For fun, experimentation, or for building a shared UX library that works across any framework of choice, my go-to
is Lit. No, I don't find it odd that Vue 3, Lit, and React Functional Components are all entirely different methods of writing a component but I still like them the best. Such a silly
question.

Anywho, this is where I info-dump mildly interesting nonsense about things I find interesting in the world of development, when I can find the time to do so.
